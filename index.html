	    <h3>Mission</h3>
	    <p>The goal of √mathroots is to increase diversity in the mathematical community by helping strong students from underrepresented backgrounds develop their interest in mathematics and to set them on a path toward pursuing a math-based major in college.</p>
	   
	      <p>Founded in 2015, √mathroots was inspired by the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-trained-%E2%80%9Cmathletes%E2%80%9D-score-high-tunis-olympiad">PAMO 2012 pilot project</a>, documented in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEuLUO4Si7g">this video</a> by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It is hosted at MIT by the <a href="http://mit.edu/primes">PRIMES</a> program, and <a href="http://mathroots.mit.edu/program/people/">led</a> by MIT faculty, staff, and students with a special interest and background in creative and competitive mathematics.</p>

	    <h3>Academics: Learn by doing</h3>
	      <p>√mathroots is a 14-day summer program hosted by MIT PRIMES for promising high school students from underrepresented backgrounds or underserved communities who are interested in exploring creative topics in mathematics. Students will discover new mathematical ideas and learn problem solving skills through a series of classes, group activities, and invited lectures led by a team of instructors with diverse experiences teaching both research and competition math.</p>

	    </div>

	      <p>The program features:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Creative problem solving outside the standard curriculum</li>
		<li>Exposure to beautiful yet accessible ideas in mathematics</li>
		<li>Introduction to techniques and meaning of mathematical proof</li>
		<li>An academic and cultural community of like-minded peers, mentors, and instructors</li>

	      <p><em>Let’s play a game, you and I:</em></p>
	      <p><em>We take turns writing a number from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 on the board.</em></p>
	      <p><em>Once 1000 numbers have been written on the board, the game ends. You</em>
		<em>win if the sum of the numbers on the board is divisible by 9,</em>
		<em>otherwise I win.</em></p>
	      <p><em>You can choose whether to go first or second. How can you win the</em>
		<em>game? What if we can only write numbers from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?</em></p>
	      <p><em>If learning how to win this game appeals to you, √mathroots may be for you!</em></p>

	    <h3>Residential: Join a community of excellence</h3>
	    <p class="p1">√mathroots is a residential program hosted on the MIT campus. Students will live in a dormitory under the supervision of Residential Counselors, MIT undergraduate and graduate students, who will oversee their health and well-being. Room, board and meals are included for all students admitted to the program.</p>
